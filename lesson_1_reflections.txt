How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I can locate the difference easily. And it saved a lot time for me.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Adopt version control

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Git: pros:explicit locial control cons: human make mistakes
    Google Docs : pros: higher security of my data. cons: locigally discreted

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    In our project, Files have dependencies, We need to keep track on all of them
    to keep our project consistent.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I use git log to find the objective version ID and compare it to another using
    git diff,which will show me what has been deleted and what has been added

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can track my bugs with help of it without damage my project.
    Also, Git allowed me to do a lot of trials.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I'd like to try managing my project.
