What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

 1. Git created a .git directory for me. and I was on my master branch now. in one words, I initialized my repo now.
 2.I need to creat a repo for my project, so I can track it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

 Stageing area keep only part of all files in the working directory in tracking.
 That means we can obtain fine-grained control over my project. and keep some files out of tracking.
